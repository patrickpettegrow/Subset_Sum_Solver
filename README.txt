Here is the collection of 'stuff' I used in the capstone. Primarily two items: java program and python program.

Contents:
	-Java Folder:     This contains the source code for the programs in Java I used. This includes the three algorithms and the testing
			environment that I had made (a simple language to generate data faster, an example command would be 'testp fileIN 100-200 fileOUT'
			where the 100-200 is the target values to test over. Included are some of the raw data generated and test results.
			It is not well documented, so if you need to run it for any reason it would be best to notify me (it was done for personal use).

	-Python Folder:	This is the python script I had used to generate some of the graphs. I made the error (when exploring some relationships) to do
			so by hard coding the parameters. This lead to me being unable to reproduce much of the graphs or data I looked at (as if I had
			some place to put 20-50 graphs).
